        <p> During my years in highschool (Bayside Highschool Queens, NY), I was part of our highschool's robotics team, 
            where I learned how to code, engineer, and 3d model. That is where my passion
            of programming came in. I learned how to program since I was in 9th grade,
            and up until now I have been studying Computer Science for 8 years. I have 
            completed my highschool diploma from 2019-2022 in Computer Science, then entered
            St.John's University 22' as an undergraduate Computer Science Major, and will be
            expected to graduate this May 2026. I have mastered how to game design, create
            different websites, front-end and back-end developed many projects. I want to
            continue my education in Master's in a couple of years from now and hopefully
            also achieve getting a PHD.
        </p>
